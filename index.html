    <h1>The People's Academy Awards</h1>

     For me, there's nothing better than seeing a great movie at the cinemas and Academy season means a great movie is usually a sure bet. However, movies are expensive and sometimes the movie doesn't live up to it's hype(shattered!). 

     This way we can lower our expectations with that five-out-of-five-critically-acclaimed-masterpiece and rush into cinemas to see that underrated Best Picture that the critics didn't like so much.

    Green dots are where users have voted a movie higher than critics</br>
    Red dots are where users have voted a movie lower than critics</br>
    Black rectangle represents hype where hype = Rotten Tomato users % vs. Rotten Tomato critics %</br>
    Only scores that varied more than 5% are shown in black</br>
