    No critics, no Members of the Academy - just Rotten Tomatoes users.
    </br>
    These are the Best Pictures that had a discrepency of 10%+ between critics and users.

    <p class ="small bold">Bold titles are the People's Choice for that year</p>
    <p class = "small">
    Green dot = Users liked it more than critics</br>
    Red dot = Users disliked it more than critics</br>
    Black rectangle represents the difference in critic % and user %</br>
    Only scores that varied 10%+ are shown in black</br>
